**Announcement**: (07/28/2022) We recently made updates to the directory structure. Dashboards and alerts are now stored in their own directories, `dashboards/` and `alert-policies` respectively. For more information on the new structure, see our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

# New Relic One quickstarts

> Only users with full platform access can use the dashboards installed with a quickstart.

New Relic One quickstarts help accelerate your New Relic journey by providing immediate value for your specific use cases. They include:

- Clear instructions for instrumenting your services
- Observability building blocks like dashboards and alerts

All of this is available through our [Instant Observability](https://developer.newrelic.com/instant-observability) open source ecosystem where New Relic developers, partners, and customers contribute their best-practice solutions.

## New Relic One Instant Observability

> Looking for inspiration?

You can search for all the available quickstarts in the [New Relic Instant Observability catalog](https://developer.newrelic.com/instant-observability).

## Getting Started

> Review our comprehensive [Developer Guide](https://developer.newrelic.com/contribute-to-quickstarts/) to get starting building your quickstart!

Head over to our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to define your own quickstart! 

## Testing

### Importer (Deprecated)

> WARNING: The importer is for testing only and might change or be removed in the future. You can still use it today for testing, but it is not meant to be used in a production environment.

We've included an `importer` utility for testing quickstarts on your account. You can run this using the included [import.sh](./import.sh) script.

> Note: The importer spins up a docker container, so you must have docker installed and running for this to function

1. Modify [importer-config.sh](./importer-config.sh) with your account number and New Relic API Key
2. Run [import.sh](./import.sh) from the root of this project:

   ```bash
   # Usage:
   ./import.sh $QUICKSTART_NAME

   # Example
   > ./import.sh mysql
   ```

   If your quickstart is in a sub-directory please include that too for example `python/flask`

```
 # Example
 > ./import.sh python/flask
```
